/*
  Removed conflicting styles:

  - The :root variables (--background, --foreground, --font-poppins) are no longer needed
    as colors and fonts are managed by Tailwind utilities and next/font.
  - The @font-face rule for Poppins is handled by next/font/google in RootLayout.js,
    which optimizes font loading.
  - The body styles (background, color, font-family) are applied via Tailwind classes
    in RootLayout.js.
